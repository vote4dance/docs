<h1>Getting started</h1>

If you want, you can create a practice competition (free of charge) and try the system yourself. Here are some good starting notes:
* Create a practice competition
* Create some classes (categories)
* Add a few start numbers to test with
* Run class "Guide" with default settings and set number of participant to your expected count
* Add yourself as judge and set marks/placement
* Send dancers through to next round or see final results
* Try the screens to see how you can present

You can also try:
* Add a registration period and register yourself as participant, then import registrations
* Adjust the schedule and add bullet points
